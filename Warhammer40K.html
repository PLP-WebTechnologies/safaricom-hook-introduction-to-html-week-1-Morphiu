          <h2>INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS WARHAMMER 40K?</h2>
          
          <p>Warhammer 40K is a fictional universe that tries to depict what advancements humanity will have <br>
           made 38,000 years from now. Advancements such as space travel, surgeries that can allow you to lift <br> 
           tonnes of heavy equipment and mobile exoskeletons all in the name of spreading your religion across <br>
           the galaxy.</p>

           <p>
            It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries, the emperor has sat immobile on the golden <br>throne of earth. 
            He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might <br>of his inexhaustible armies.
            He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from Dark Age technology. <br>
            </p>
            
            <p>He is the carrion lord of the imperium for 
            whom a thousand souls are sacrificed today, so that he may never truly die. <br>To be a man in such times is to be amongst
            untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. <br>Forget the power of technology and science
            for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned.<br> Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the dark
            future, there is only war.
